            <p>
              Set in Hong Kong, 1962, Chow Mo-Wan is a newspaper editor who
              moves into a new building with his wife. At the same time, Su
              Li-zhen, a beautiful secretary and her executive husband also move
              in to the crowded building. With their spouses often away, Chow
              and Li-zhen spend most of their time together as friends. They
              have everything in common from noodle shops to martial arts. Soon,
              they are shocked to discover that their spouses are having an
              affair. Hurt and angry, they find comfort in their growing
              friendship even as they resolve not to be like their unfaithful
              mates.

              Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that "In the hands of a hack,
              In the Mood for Love could have been a snickering sex farce. In
              the hands of Wong Kar-wai ... the film is alive with delicacy and
              feeling". Peter Walker of The Guardian, describing it as his
              "favourite film", wrote that it provides "profound and moving
              reflections on life's fundamentals. It's a film about, yes, love;
              but also betrayal, loss, missed opportunities, memory, the
              brutality of time's passage, loneliness—the list goes on". David
              Parkinson of Empire awarded the film five out of five stars,
              writing that "the performances are masterly, and the photography
              beautiful. It's a genuinely romantic romance and makes for sublime
              cinema."

              <p>
                In the Mood for Love went through a long gestation period. In
                the 1990s, Wong Kar-wai found some commercial success, much
                critical acclaim, and wide influence on other filmmakers
                throughout Asia and the world with films such as Chungking
                Express and Fallen Angels, both set in present-day Hong Kong.
                His 1997 film Happy Together was also successful
                internationally, winning him Best Director at the Cannes Film
                Festival and surprising many. It was even popular with
                mainstream audiences in Hong Kong, despite its then-unusual
                focus on a gay love story and its having been largely improvised
                in Argentina, a landscape unfamiliar to Wong.

                Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Hong Kong film director,
                screenwriter, and producer. His films are characterised by
                nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid
                cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal
                figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong is considered a contemporary
                auteur, and ranks third on Sight & Sound's 2002 poll of the
                greatest filmmakers of modern times. His films frequently appear
                on best-of lists domestically and internationally.

                  cares about how she looks and how others perceive her. Behind
                  her beautiful dresses and impeccable makeup, there is a very
                  lonely woman.<br>Despite of having a husband, Su is alone in
                  her marriage. Her husband is emotionally and physically
                  absent. Mr. Su is constantly travelling due the nature of his
                  job. Moreover, he often meets his mistress (Chow’s wife) when
                  he’s abroad.

                  is cheating on him. Nonetheless, Chow still hopes that things
                  will change. He wants to give their marriage another chance.
                  However, his priorities change when he starts to hang out with
                  Su.<br>Just like Su, Chow is the type of person that keeps
                  his feelings to himself. Even his closest friends have no idea
                  what’s really going on in his life. Although, Chow hates the
                  idea of infidelity, through his encounters with Su, he changed
                  his mind on this matter. When Chow developed feelings for Su,
                  he realized that people don’t cheat on purpose. Sometimes, two
                  people can grown fond of each other without a logical reason
                  behind it.

                  The title track "Hua Yang De Nian Hua" is a song by famous
                  singer 'Zhou Xuan' from the Solitary Island period. The 1946
                  song is a paean to a happy past and an oblique metaphor for
                  the darkness of Japanese-occupied Shanghai. Wong also set the
                  song to his 2000 short film, named Hua Yang De Nian Hua, after
                  the track.

              那是一種難堪的相對。她一直羞低著頭，給他一個接近的機會。他沒有勇氣接近。她轉身，走了。
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered... to give
              him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of
              courage. She turns and walks away.

              <strong>蘇麗珍 Su Li-zhen, Mrs. Chan</strong>
              <p>
                Su is woman that cares about appearances. Having said that, Su
                cares about how she looks and how others perceive her. Behind
                her beautiful dresses and impeccable makeup, there is a very
                lonely woman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite of having a husband, Su is alone in her marriage. Her
                husband is emotionally and physically absent. Mr. Su is
                constantly travelling due the nature of his job. Moreover, he
                often meets his mistress (Chow’s wife) when he’s abroad.

              <strong>周慕雲 Chow Mo-wan</strong>
              <p>
                Chow is a man that loves his wife. He’s aware that his wife is
                cheating on him. Nonetheless, Chow still hopes that things will
                change. He wants to give their marriage another chance. However,
                his priorities change when he starts to hang out with Su.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like Su, Chow is the type of person that keeps his feelings
                to himself. Even his closest friends have no idea what’s really
                going on in his life. Although, Chow hates the idea of
                infidelity, through his encounters with Su, he changed his mind
                on this matter. When Chow developed feelings for Su, he realized
                that people don’t cheat on purpose. Sometimes, two people can
                grown fond of each other without a logical reason behind it.
